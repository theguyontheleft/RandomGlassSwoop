#RandomGlassSwoop
====================
###What does swoop mean?

This is my first glassware project developed during a short period with a Google Glass explorer. The idea is similar to my android application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=swoop.hashtagswoop. But it caters to the harder to navigate and search interface of the glasses. It provides quick easy to access entertainment.

The goal of this app is to make all of the best 
        memes and happenings on the internet randomly available to you in the corner of your eye!
        A unique feed from one of the most popular sites will be randomly selected every time you shake
          your device (or touch the button). These sites can be customized from the settings menu.

If you have any questions on it please let me know.
